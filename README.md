# Unbeatable tic-tac-toe

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mackiovello/unbeatable-tic-tac-toe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mackiovello/unbeatable-tic-tac-toe)

Command-line tic-tac-toe against an unbeatable opponent in Rust.

This is my first project for learning Rust. I've tried to experiement with many different features and get used to a more functional programming paradigm.

To run, [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html), clone this repo, `cd` into it, and run `cargo run`. The game should start between you and an opponent that is an algorithm that should never lose.  

If you, against all odds, want to contribute or fork this, you might want to know that you can run the tests by executing `cargo test`. There are 41 unit tests at the moment. It's also set up with Travis, so you can see if the tests and build passes.
